**Vehicle price prediction project**

Project consists of 4 steps:
1. Parsing data from open source (actually 2 steps in my version as I forgot to get locations suitable for Nominatim);
2. Obtain additional data on metrics that are causaly related to car prices (gos_metrics);
3. Preprocessor for raw data obtained after parsing and delete significant outliers;
4. Explanatory data analysis to understand data frame, get insight into vehicle prices, create/eliminate features;
5. Modelling and evaluation of project, points of growth for future projects.
